    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As a committed student enrolled in Athabasca University's Computer Science degree program, I am immersed in the challenges and opportunities presented by the COMP266 course. Currently, my focus revolves around the creation of a weather app, a project that encapsulates the practical application of my burgeoning web development skills. This endeavor serves as a pivotal component of my academic journey, allowing me to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and hands-on implementation. Through the meticulous development of the weather app, I am not only refining my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also cultivating a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of creating user-centric web applications.</p>
    <h2>What This App Means</h2>
    <p>Within the COMP266 course, the weather app project encapsulates my dedication to mastering the craft of web development. As I navigate through the intricacies of coding, design, and user interaction, my goal is to craft a seamless and informative experience for users seeking real-time weather updates. This project is a testament to my commitment to academic excellence and a stepping stone toward my growth as a computer scientist. As the development of the weather app unfolds, I am excited to share the culmination of my efforts, reflecting both my academic journey at Athabasca University and my passion for creating impactful and user-friendly digital solutions.</p>
